        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>SEMOSS is a data-driven application that enables users to <em></em>explore relationships and connections in an interactive format through intermediate conduits, i.e. transitive relationships.
            This document provides general usage instructions and guidance in deployment of the open source components of SEMOSS,
            in contrast to the developer guide, which provides instructions and guidance in terms of development "on top of" the tool.</br>
        </p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        
        <ul>This document contains:
            <li><a href="#">An overview of the out-of-the-box SEMOSS user interface (Section 1).</a></li>
            <li>Instructions for creating and loading a new database and developing the ontological structure (metamodel) for the database (Section 2).</li>
            <li>Limited guidance in querying databases to understand advanced relationships using the SPARQL query language (Section 3).</li>
            <li>A use case in deploying <em>out of the box</em> SEMOSS to analyze the sample security database (Section 4).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1: User Interface Overview</h3>
        <p>The SEMOSS user interface features the main tab to the left, and a workspace that displays the data outputs in the center of the screen.</p>
        <h5>1.1 Tabs Overview</h5>
        <p>There are five default tabs that exist on the setup pane. The main tab appears when the application is started; the others (Graph Labels, Graph Cosmetics, SUDOWL, and Graph Filter) can be toggled.</p>
        <br><img src="image002.png" alt="Image 002" height="" width=""></br>
        <br><img src="image003.png" alt="Image 003" height="" width=""></br>
        <br>
        <p><em><b>Main Tab</b></em></p>
        <p>The main tab is on the left once the application is started. It provides the core functionality of SEMOSS. The components of the main tab include:</p>
        <p>1. Database Selection<p>
        <p>2. Perspective Categories</p>
        <p>3. Question Selections</p>
        <p>4. Constraints</p>
        <p>5. Create Button</p>
        <p>6. Undo/Remove Button</p>
        <p>7. Augment Graph</p>
        <p>8. Custom SPARQL Query</p>
        <em><h5>Database Selection (1)</h5></em>
        <p>This is the area where the active database is selected. The map sheet contains indexes to the available databases. The map sheet is essentially an index of all of the data and information that is available within the application (more instructions on loading databases and the map sheet are contained in Section 2: Loading a Database).</p>
        <p>SEMOSS allows exploration of data residing in these databases as it is a single database.</p>
        <em><h5>Perspective Categories (2)</h5></em>
        <p>This section contains the available perspectives or different "point of views" of the data stored in the databases. A perspective allows a user to examine in detail data from a particular point of view. These details are formulated as questions pertaining to a specific perspective.</p>
        <em><h5>Question Selection (3)</h5></em>
        <p>This is where the specific question is selected to dive into details of a perspective. This question is translated by SEMOSS into a SPARQL query that will be performed to provide the answer. Section D describes how an advanced user can create a custom SPARQL query to provide an ad hoc report.</p>
        <em><h5>Constraints (4)</h5></em>
        <p>Sometimes a question (SPARQL query) requires an input parameter (such as IP Address); in this case a drop-down box will appear allowing the user to select the appropriate constraint. Additional information is deferred to the section on writing SPARQL queries.</p>
        <em><h5>Create Button (5)</h5></em>
        <p>This button executes the constructed SPARQL query and displays the result either as a graph or as a grid.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="image005.png" alt="Image005.png" height="" width=""></br>
        </br>
        <em><h5>Undo/Remove (6)</h5></em>
        <p>The undo button undoes the last action the user has taken. The first time the button is pressed, it removes relevant properties. The second time it is pressed, it removes nodes from the graph.</p>
        <p>Consequently, to completely undo the prior action, <b>this button needs to be pressed twice</b>.</p>
        <em><h5>Augment Graph (7)</h5></em>
        <p>The augment graph function allows the user to overlay components of an additional query onto a graph. This is useful when comparing connections between two comparative objects.</p>
        <em><h5>Custom SPARQL Query (8)</h5></em>
        <em><p>Editor's Note: Additional Analysis surrounding creating SPARQL queries in SEMOSS is deferred to the 'Writing SPARQL Queries in SEMOSS' Section.</p></em>
        <p>This component, when the "Custom" button is toggled, allows the user to (a) modify the current SPARQL query and (b) change the type of play sheet that the data is displayed on.  Not all query types are able to be displayed on all play sheet types, so slight query modifications are often required in order to change the play sheet.</p>
        <p>Further information about the play sheets can be found in the Developer's Guide.</p>
        <h5><a href="#">Graph Labels Tab</a></h5>
        <p>The graph labels tab allows the user to customize the labels and tooltips that are displayed on a graph. Toggling the select button for an item on or off will determine whether it is displayed. The label toggle displays the information on the graph and the tooltip displays information on a mouse-over event. Edges and nodes can both have labels attached to them.</p>
        <p>Various options exist, including the ability to display the instance name, the node type, and the URI of the node.</p>
        <h5><a href="#">Graph Cosmetics Tab</a></h5>
        <p>The graph cosmetics tab allows the user to modify the color and shape of a given node in the database. Selecting the first instance for a given node (the Select All Instance) allows a user to modify all of the instances of that node type. Default shapes and colors for a given node type can be set in the map sheet (more information is located in the database setup section of the manual).</p>
        <h5><a href="#">Graph Filter Tab</a></h5>
        <p>The graph filter tab allows the user to toggle the display of various nodes within the graph.</p>
        <p>In the middle of the filter tab is a properties window that displays the properties associated with a given node instance or edge. This is useful in exploration of properties attached to a given node.</p>
        <p>The bottom section of the filter tab contains the ability to filter the graph for various relationships or verbs within the graph. Again, selecting the first instance of a given relation (the select all instance) toggles all of the relations associated with a given node.</p>
        <h5><a href="#">SUDOWL Tab</a></h5>
        <p>The SUDOWL tab allows the user to explore the graph in the display pane without the presence of a metamodel. The property column describes each of the relationships that are displayed.</p>
        <h5>1.2: Display Pane</h5>
        <p>When the "create" button is toggled and a graph is created, a window within the display pane appears showing either a graph or a grid sheet. These sheets are where the insights are generated for future analysis.</p> 
        <h5><a href="#">Graph Play Sheet Functionality</a></h5>
        <p>The graph play sheet has a number of ways to manipulate a graph after it is created, most of which are accessible from the right click menu.  It is important to note that the right click functionality is highly dependent on whether or not a node or a group of nodes is selected as well as which node(s) is selected.  </p>
        <img src="image007.png" alt="Image007.png" height="" width=""></br>
        <h5>Show Minium Spanning Tree</h5>
        <p>This feature essentially determines the minimum amount of edges necessary to connect all of the vertices of the graph.  This functionality is useful in identification of redundancies within the network.</p>
        <h5>Highlight Adjacent</h5>
        <p>This feature highlights all of the nodes that are adjacent to a selected node. This can be useful in identification of connections in a cluttered graph. </p>
        <h5>Move Graph</h5>
        <p>Move graph allows the user to move the whole graph as a single image about the canvas. To revert back to the default selection after a graph is moved to the preferred location, select the pick graph mode.</p>
        <h5>Pick Graph</h5>
        <p>Pick Graph allows the user to select specific nodes on the graph and move them about the canvas. This option is the default selection when the tool is opened.</p>
        <h5>Convert to Table</h5>
        <p>This feature creates a table of all of the triples that are currently being used to display the graph.</p>
        <h5>Traverse Freely From Node</h5>
        <p>This feature allows the user to extend the graph from the selected node(s) to any of the node types that are upstream or downstream of it (them).  This will connect all nodes of the same type to their respective node instances.</p
        <h5>Traverse Freely from Selected Instance</h5>
        <p>This feature allows the user to connect to various upstream and downstream nodes that are connected to this particular instance in the RDF store. This will connect only the selected instance to its respective node instances.</p>
        <h5>Extend Graph</h5>
        <p>Extend graph allows the user to add in additional components based on a given set of constraints.</p>
        <h5>Perform Algorithms</h5>
        <p>Various algorithms are included in the initial open source version of SEMOSS. These algorithms provide insights into various components of the graph. Currently the following algorithms are included:
            <table class="">
         <ul><li>NodeRank Algorithm: Ranks the nodes based on the number of times the node is referenced/used.</li>
         <li>Distance Downstream: Provides the number of ‘hops’ downstream data travels across systems.</li>
         <li>Loop Identifier: Identifies instances where certain data is sent to and from the same system.</li>
         <li>Island Identifier: Identifies instances where the flow of a data object is interrupted. In other words, islands of data exist. In some cases this could be a requirement. In others this could highlight areas of data management issues.</li>
         <li>Data Latency Analysis: Allows user to manually adjust the time bar to track data through the network of systems.</li>
         <li>Data Latency Scenario: Automatically distributes the data based on the data frequency of interfaces.</li></ul>
    <tbody>table</tbody>
    </table>
        <p>There are other other functions associated with each engine as well. Please refer to Javadoc at ___________________________ for additional information.</p>
        <h5>4.2: Types of Engines</h5>
        <p>Version 1.0 of SEMOSS contains a number of different engine types that provide the ability to handle data in a number of different formats. The biggest differentiator between the engine classes is that some support local data repositories while others connect to remote repositories.</p>
        <h5>4.2.1 Local Data Repository</h5>
        <p>Local repositories are databases that reside in the "db" folder of the SEMOSS tool. There are a few local repository engine classes that are supported as of Version 1.0. SEMOSS at any given time can have multiple engines running of the same type, but each engine must connect to a unique data store. The data stores that these local data engine classes connect to must be local to a given user's application.</p>
        <p>The following table lays out the different engine classes that connect to local repositories:</p>
        <table class="">
    <tbody>table</tbody>
    </table>
        <h5>4.2.2 Remote Server Repository (NEED TO LOOK AT THIS SECTION)</h5>
        <p>Remote repositories are databases that reside on another server and require a live connection for the engine to access it. These databases usually require a REST API on the remote Apache server and there can be multiple access entries. The following table lays out the current engines that connect to remote data stores:</p>
        <table class="">
    <tbody>table</tbody>
    </table>
        <h3>5: SEMOSS Play Sheets</h3>
        <p>Play sheets in SEMOSS are the components that filter, analyze and visualize data. There are a number of different play sheets with unique visualization components, allowing for the same data to be displayed and manipulated in very different ways.</p>
        <p>Play sheets are setup similarly to the way engines are set up. The following section takes an in-depth look at the play sheet interface as well as each of the play sheet classes currently implemented in SEMOSS.</p>
        <h5>5.2: IPlaySheet</h5>
        <p>The IPlaySheet.java class is the play sheet interface for SEMOSS. All play sheets implement this interface which includes the basic functions of a data visualizer.</p>
        <p>Here's a table of some of the most important functions of this interface.</p>
        <table class="">
    <tbody>table</tbody>
    </table>
        <p>There are other functions associated with play sheets as well. Please refer to the Javadoc at ___________________________ for additional information.</p>
        <h5>5.3: Types of Play Sheets</h5>
        <p>SEMOSS 1.0 is packaged with three different play sheet types.  Two of the play sheets are very similar in the way they display data&#8212;GridPlaySheet and GridRAWPlaysheet &#8212; but differ in the way they process the data.</p>
        <p>The third play sheet, GraphPlaySheet, visualizes and processes the data very differently than the first two, creating a network graph rather than a grid.  The following section briefly describes each play sheet.</p>
        <h5>5.3.1 GridPlaySheet</h5>
        <p>GridPlaySheet.java is the component class that generates a table as the means of visualizing the data. This play sheet currently requires a SELECT SPARQL query to process the data correctly.</p>
        <p>The table can be sorted by clicking on a column header and the data can easily be copied and pasted into Excel.  More information on this play sheet's functionality can be found in the SEMOSS User Guide.</p>
        <p>The following is a print screen of what the results look like in a GridPlaySheet.</p>
        <h5>5.3.2 GridRAWPlaySheet</h5>
        <p>GridRAWPlaySheet.java is similar to GridPlaySheet in that they both generate tables as data visualization.</p>
        <p>The main distinction is in the processing of the data&#8212;GridRAWPlaySheet stores and displays full URI's whereas GridPlaySheet only deals with the instance level of each RDF component.</p>
        <p>Like GridPlaySheet, this play sheet requires a SPARQL SELECT query to correctly process the data.</p>
        <p>The following is a print screen of what the results look like in a GridPlaySheet.</p>
        <img src="#" alt="insert image 2" height="" width="">
        <h5>5.3.3 GraphPlaySheet</h5>
        <p>GraphPlaySheet.java is the play sheet class that generates a graph network for its data visualization.</p>
        <p>This play sheet processes the data very differently than the grid play sheets because it must get the data into a format that is recognized by the graphing component, Jung. This play sheet generally uses a CONSTRUCT SPARQL query. GraphPlaySheet has a lot of peripheral functionality as well that is accessible through the right click menu. Please reference the SEMOSS User Guide for further information on these functionalities.</p>
        <p>The following is a print screen of what the results look like in a GraphPlaySheet:</p>
        <img src="#" alt="insert image 2" height="" width="">
        <h3>6: Understanding Ontology</h3></a>
        <p>The value of insights derived from SEMOSS is directly correlated to properness of the semantic ontologies that has been developed for the structure of the data. Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing the pieces of information in a database.</p>
        <p>A proper domain-specific metamodel can be an ontology. Creating metamodels involve the construction of concepts (data) and their relationships (how data pieces relate to each other).</p>
        <p>By learning how to effectively create and use metamodels, analysts can explore databases and identify meaningful insights inside SEMOSS. Usually, a metamodel is displayed as a map, as shown below for our security database in Figure 6.1.1.</p>
        <p>Development of the metamodel is one of the <em><b>most important and complex task</b></em> that needs to be completed in order to be able to efficiently and effectively extract data from the engine.</p>
        <p>If the metamodel is not thorough, straightforward, and comprehensive, it will be very difficult to extract insights from any set of data. The most important paradigm to consider is that the metamodel should be constructed based on the fundamental relationships between the data, as opposed to a structure that is based on answering specific, known, questions from the data.</p>
        <p>This allows the database to be queried based on prospective insights (as opposed to modifying the database to allow for this to happen).</p>
        <p>Figure 2.1.1 below contains the base metamodel for our sample security metamodel. The metamodel is constructed such that each of the node types and its relationships with other node types is represented by boxes and lines.</p>
