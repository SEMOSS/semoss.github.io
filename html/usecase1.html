								<h3 class="feature">How does the goal of improving laboratory align with my IT portfolio?</h3>
								<p class="margin medium lead feature">Laboratory as an enterprise capability can take on a lot of different meanings, thus in order to understand how to improve the capability, I first must learn what it means to perform Laboratory in terms of actionable steps. My enterprise has mapped the various elements that make up Lab, and SEMOSS makes it easy to view and understand these breakdowns.</p>
								<p class="margin medium lead">In the graph to the right I can see how the capability of Lab breaks into business processes and then further into activities. I can also see connected to each activity the data objects required to perform that activity. Next, I’m going to take a look at the related systems to each of these data objects. 
								</p>
								<p class="margin medium lead">I’ve gone ahead and extended this graph from the Patient ID data object to see which systems create, read, and/or modify that data. Explore for yourself what systems are related to the other data objects by double clicking the other DataObjects (orange nodes) and then selecting ‘System’ from the dropdown in the upper right of the graph. 
								</p><p class="margin medium lead">We now have a holistic view of all the systems that support the laboratory capability. It stands out that Patient ID is held by a large number of systems. This is expensive to maintain, often leads to poor data quality, and is likely to cause data latency issues.
								</p>
								</p><p class="margin medium lead">Let’s explore why and how so many systems are using Patient ID.

								<h3>How does this data flow through my enterprise?</h3>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Let’s take a closer look at how each system uses and passes Patient ID. This network of system-to-system communications is easily visualized through SEMOSS and gives us a better understanding of the complex dependencies that exist within the enterprise.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">In the graph to the left we see how Patient ID data travels back and forth between the systems, exposing hidden dependencies and showing the relative importance of each system.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">In particular, we see that System 6 is one of only two systems with a direct relationship with the data object, meaning that it is a creator of Patient ID data, and the vast majority of the other systems depend on System 6 for their own Patient ID data. System 5 in comparison has no systems below it, meaning that no systems depend on System 5 for Patient ID data, and is thus relatively less important.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Now that we understand each systems’ role in supporting this one data object, let’s take a look at how these systems support the enterprise on a larger level.</p>

								<h3>How healthy is my portfolio as a whole?</h3>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Our application healthgrid calculates and presents the business value, technical maturity, and sustainment budget of each system or application to give insight into each one’s“health” relative to the portfolio as a whole.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">These three coordinates depict how well each system is supporting the enterprise, how well the enterprise is supporting each system, and finally how much each system is costing the enterprise, providing a comprehensive high-level view of the portfolio. </p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Hover over some of the bubbles to see which systems seem to be delivering most effectively. In this case, System 5 on the left has large sustainment costs but  is not delivering business value equal to this amount of input. On the other side we see System 6 has even larger sustainment costs but one of the highest business values and a solid technical score as well, perhaps justifying the high costs associated.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">We now understand how each system fits into the enterprise as a whole and have identified some systems that should be nurtured, such as System 6, and some that could possibly be decommissioned, such as System 5 . Let’s take a look at system similarity to uncover redundancies that exist among our systems and discover unique functionality that may make a system crucial to the enterprise. </p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">This additional layer of information will give us the tools to make a more informed decision on investing or retiring systems. </p>

								<h3>What redundancies exist among my systems?</h3>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Redundancies can be hard to spot and may exist at various levels in an enterprise. They increase the budget and reduce throughput of an enterprise, resulting in lower ROI. The System Similarity Heat Map provides an easy way to see how much duplication exists at each level.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Earlier, we identified System 5, as not critical with respect to Patient ID, insignificant with respect to business value, and expensive to maintain. Now let’s click on System 5 along the top of the map so that the column lights-up. We see that all of its properties are duplicated by other systems in the enterprise--it provides nothing unique. This means that it is a strong candidate for decommissioning.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">System 6, on the other hand, has a number of properties that no other system in the enterprise currently provides. This further suggests that it is a critical system that should be well maintained.</p>
								<p class="medium lead margin">Through these various visualizations, we have just completed a holistic analysis of our portfolio and have begun to get an idea of what systems can be looked at for retirement and which should be upgraded and maintained.</p>
