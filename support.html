								<h4 class="margin">Creating a new database engine</h4>
								<p class="feature">This is the set of steps that must be completed in order to create a new database engine and to load new data to the engine from Excel. Note that some of these steps may be done simultaneously, but all of the steps must be completed to create a fully functional engine.</p>
								<p class="feature margin">There are other ways to create an engine and connect it to a data store, but this is the easiest way, assuming that the data is not already structured and formatted.</p>
									<ul id="list">Identify and understand the data and the relationships within the data.</ul>
									<ul id="list">Develop the metamodel</ul>
									<ul id="list">Load the metamodel objects and their relationships into SEMOSS' properties sheet</ul>
									<ul id="list">Identify the engine used to generate the database (If using big data engine, develop the excel-based loading sheets and set up the reader)</ul>
									<ul id="list">Load the loading sheets and generate the database</ul>
									<ul id="list">Create and maintain the questions sheet</ul>
									<p class="feature margin">A tutorial video can be accessed at this link depicting how to create a new database engine:<a class="learnmore-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY1aOGH7VU4">here.</a></p>
									<h6 class="darkgray">Develop the metamodel</h6>
									<p class="feature">The creation of a metamodel involves the construction of concepts (data) and their relationships (how data pieces relate to each other) and consequently provides analysts with a framework through which to explore the database and identify meaningful insights.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Usually, the metamodel is displayed as a map, as shown below for our security database in Figure 2.1.1.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Development of the metamodel is one of the most important and complex tasks that needs to be completed in order to be able to efficiently and effectively extract data from the engine. If the metamodel is not thorough, straightforward, and comprehensive, it will be very difficult to extract insights from any set of data. The most important paradigm to consider is that the metamodel should be constructed based on the fundamental relationships between the data, as opposed to a structure that is based on answering specific, known, questions from the data.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">This allows the database to be queried based on prospective insights (as opposed to modifying the database to allow for this to happen).</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Figure 2.1.1 below contains the base metamodel for our sample security database. The metamodel is constructed such that each of the node types and its relationships with other node types is represented by boxes and lines.</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img5.png" style="max-width:100%">
									<p class="feature"> Figure 2.1.1 Security Database Model</p>
									<h6 class="darkgray">Load the Metamodel relationships into the map sheet</h6>
									<p class="feature italic">Note: This section only applies if loading from an Excel loading sheet.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Once the metamodel is created, the base objects and relationships must be loaded into the RDF map sheet, named in the initial open-source release RDF_Map.prop. This step ensures that the data loads successfully and correctly aligns with the previously designed metamodel.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Note that all components are case sensitive. Therefore case must be consistent across all instances for matches to work correctly.</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Base Objects</p>
									<p class="feature">Here all of the base objects are added (i.e. the individual nodes in the metamodel that represent a node type within SEMOSS).</p>
									<p class="feature">First, Navigate to the ##Base Objects## Section of the map sheet.</p>
										<p class="feature">Then, for each new base object (e.g. type AssetID) enter the name, tab over, and enter the URI for the base object. The base objects for the security database (based on the metamodel identified above) would be:</p>
								<div class="code">
										<p>##Base Objects##</p>
										<p>AssetID http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/AssetID</p>
										<p>IPAddress http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/IPAddress</p>
										<p>UserName http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/UserName</p>
										<p>Employee http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/Employee</p>

										<p>Site http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/Site</p>
									</div>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Base Relations</p>
									<p class="feature">Here the relationships that exist in the metamodel are added.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">First, navigate to the ##Base Predicates## Section of the prop sheet.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Then, for each predicate (e.g. UserName_AssignedTo_AssetID) enter the name, tab over, and enter the URI for the relation.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The base objects for the security database (based on the metamodel identified above) would be:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>##Base Predicates##</p>
										<p> AssetID_Accesses_IPAddress    http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation/Accesses</p>
										<p>UserName_AssignedTo_AssetID   http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation/AssignedTo</p>
										<p>Employee_Has_UserName         http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation/Has</p>
										<p>Employee http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept/Employee</p>
										<p>Employee_AssignedTo_Site      http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation/AssignedTo</p>
										<p>AssetID_Accesses_Server       http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation/Accesses</p>
									</div>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Base Relationships</p>
									<p class="feature">For each of the new node types and verbs, the base relationship is added to denote what type of object it is. For this first component, BaseMetaRelationships, all of the nodes that are of type concept (i.e. a node) are added. The structure is such that the node types in question (http://Sdb.com/ ontologies/ Concept/ IPAddress) are first, the standards-based predicate (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#subClassOf) to denote the subclass is second, and the class (http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Concept) is the final component.</p>
									
									<p class="feature margin">The same task is then completed for BaseMetaProperties, thus, each of the new relationships is loaded into the prop sheets. The structure is such that the node types in question (http://Sdb.com/ ontologies/ Relation/ AssignedTo) are first, the standards-based predicate (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/ rdf-schema#subPropertyOf) to denote the subclass is second, and the property (http://Sdb.com/ontologies/Relation) is the final component. </p>
									
									<p class="darkgray margin">Setting the Engine</p>
									<p class="feature">The final task that needs to be completed is the engine setup. Completion of this step requires a decision to be made in identification of the engine to be used and creation of the questions sheet; explanation of this process is deferred to their respective process step sections.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The code that needs to be added simply specifies the engine and database locations that are used to setup the database to be shown, so once decided, this can be added.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">At the top of the prop sheet, modify it such that the engine and locations are selected. Consider this example for the security database. The first component specifies the databases that are loaded; multiple databases can be loaded and are delimited by semicolons.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The second component is the engine used to read the database, the third is the prop sheet location (more on the prop sheet in future steps), and the final sheet is the questions sheet.</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>ENGINES	Security</p>

										<p>Security_PROP     db/demo/Security.properties</p>
										<p>Security_DREAMER  questions/Security_Questions.properties</p>
									</div>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Other Functionalities (Optional)</p>
									<p class="feature">Other functionalities in the prop sheet can be added, included entering default colors and shapes for nodes. The base colors for the security database are entered as below:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>#Shape maps</p>
										<p>Site_SHAPE        SQUARE</p>
										<p>IPAddress_SHAPE   TRIANGLE</p>
										<p>UserName_SHAPE    HEXAGON</p>
										<p>AssetID_SHAPE     DIAMOND</p>

										<p>AssetID_COLOR     BROWN</p>
										<p>Employee_COLOR    GREEN</p>
									</div>
									<h6 class="darkgray">Generating Loading Sheets</h6>
									<p class="feature">Selecting the engine defines the process through which the database is read into SEMOSS. This manual documents the use of the Big Data Engine, which provides the added functionality of converting Excel-based inputs into the database.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The loading sheets are setup such that there is an introductory loader tab, and a tab that contains an individual set of triples (e.g. all of the AssetID to IP Address relationships).</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Loader Tab</p>
									<p class="feature">The Loader tab essentially contains the name of the sheets that are read into the database. The name of the tab must be "Loader", and adjacent in column B to each of the tabs that are loaded should be the text "Usual."</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Cell A1 should contain the text "SheetName" and Cell B1 must contain the text "Type."</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The tab should be constructed as follows (example for the security database):</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img6.png" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 2.3.1 Loader Tab</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Relation Tabs: Loading Triples</p>
									<p class="feature">The other tabs should individually contain specific information surrounding an individual triple store that is to be loaded into the database. For example, . Cell A1 should contain the text "Relation", Cell A2 should contain the predicate (AssignedTo in this case), Cell B1 should contain the first node type (e.g. UserName), and cell C1 should contain the second node type (e.g. AssetID).</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Column B should contain the actual first node instances, and column C should contain the second node instances. Properties on the edges (e.g. not triples, but data that may be relevant as a property such as a cost) can be attached in adjacent columns. Note that the property is not added to the node, but rather, the edge. To add properties to nodes a separate type of sheet is required (as documented below). Properties do not need to be added in the prop sheet, but are more difficult to visualize and query (example shown in figure 2.3.2 for the security database).</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img7.png" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 2.3.2 Sample Triple Loading Sheet</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Node Property Tabs: Loading Properties</p>
									<p class="feature">In the case where a property is desired to be added onto a node as opposed to a node edge (as above), a separate tab is necessary to be created to show this information. The structure of the sheet is displayed below for the Site property sheet for the security database, where city and state are denoted as properties of an individual site name.</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img8.png" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 2.3.3 Sample Property Loading Sheet</p>
									<h6 class="darkgray">Building the Database</h6>
									<p class="feature">Once the excel files are generated, the database needs to be created.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">There are two options to create a database: using the user interface import functionality or using the POIReader java file (POIReader is explained in the developer guide). The user interface is somewhat more intuitive, and does not require manual modification of the java code. However, it is not as efficient in processing multiple workbooks or debugging potential loading sheet data issues.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">When updating a database (i.e. modifying the data in a current data), the best mechanism to ensure that duplicates do not exist is to delete the old .jnl file and then reload all of the new loading sheets from the workspace. This process tends to lend itself better to POIReader than the UI update.</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">UI Import</p>
									<p class="feature">The user interface on the DB Modification Tab provides the capability to generate a new database engine without having to process through code. However, it is difficult to debug loading sheets with errors in the UI Import, and does not streamline the import of multiple files simultaneously.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Within the user interface import, there are two options: add to existing database, and create a new database.</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Add to Existing Database</p>
									<p class="feature">This option will load all triples specified in the Excel workbook on top of an already running database. Nothing will be overwritten in the previously existing database. If an exact triple specified in the workbook already exists in the database, the triple will remain but will not be duplicated (in this instance, , and all must match).</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The database to be augmented must be selected in the database selection main tab on the left.</p>
									<p class="darkgray margin">Create New Database</p>
									<p class="feature">This option will create a completely new database and automatically have it populated on the left panel. The name of the new database cannot contain any spaces. All objects types and predicate types must be contained in the Base Objects and Base Predicates of the map file. The map file cannot be open when the import is running.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The files that are created (Assuming that the inputted name is "NewDBName"):</p>
									<ul id="list">BigDataProp.properties. This prop file will be created in the db folder; It specifies all of the Big Data Engine properties.</ul>
									<ul id="list"> .jnl. This file will be created in the db folder and is the triple store with all of the new created triples.</ul>
									<ul id="list"> _Questions.properties. This file will be created in the questions folder. It specifies what perspectives, questions, and associated queries are populated when the new engine is selected. It uses the basic default question sheet, and provides the user with the capability to add in additional questions on top of this database.</ul>
									<p class="feature margin">In addition, the map sheet is edited directly in the project folder to contain the new databases such that when the new db is created, it will appear in the navigation menu.</p>
			</div>	
			<div id="sparqlqueries">
									<h4 class="margin">SPARQL Queries within SEMOSS</h4>
									<p class="feature">SPARQL is the query language used to query different databases within SEMOSS. Querying in SPARQL is a means of retrieving or creating meaningful data from an RDF triple store.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">This document does not provide in-depth guidance in generating SPARQL queries, for additional guidance, it is suggested to purchase Learning SPRAQL by Bob DuCharme. More information can be found <a class="learnmore-link" href="www.learningsparql.com">here</a>, and the book can be purchased on Amazon <a class="learnmore-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-SPARQL-Bob-DuCharme/dp/1449306594">here</a>. More information can be found <a class="learnmore-link" href="solutions.html">here.</a></p>
									<p class="feature margin">In the semantics-based RDF ontology, this high-level framework provides the context through which data is structured. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a data model for encoding, gathering, and representing information about resources. Elements in RDF are stored as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and are always part of a triple. Constructed like a sentence (with a subject, predicate, and object) the triple structure is relational in form. A triple is defined as where "< >" denotes a URI. For example, an Employee has a UserName (constructed as . These categories (e.g. Employee) are called types, which contain specific instances (e.g. John Smith). Thus, John Smith has J_Smith, or, < John Smith > < John Smith:J_Smith > < J_Smith >.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">There are multiple types of queries available to SPARQL, however only the SELECT (which results in grids) and CONSTRUCT (which results in graphs) queries are used.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">A query has three major parts: The Query Type (SELECT or CONSTRUCT), the return variables (what is to be returned from the query), and the pattern that the triples must follow, in other words as structured:</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img11.jpg" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature margin">To query the database it is important to note the URI (Uniform Resource Index) of the particular types(s) that are to be queried. The query below is a simple query for the Security database, which traverses from the Asset ID to IP Address, based on a specified IP Address. This query would be used to identify what assets (computers) have visited a particular website, in identification of the cause of a particular virus. Additionally, the user can then extend from that particular object (traverse freely) through to other nodes to identify additional insights. This is performed by right clicking on the node in question and traversing to the desired additional node.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Here, a CONSTRUCT query is used because a graph is generated. Second, since only one relationship is traversed, from AccessID to IP Address, the result set is:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>{?AssetID ?Accesses ?IPAddress}</p>
									</div>
									<p class="feature margin">Next, the patterns to be traversed are added. First, the components the user will select are added (denoted by two variables encapsulated by '@' signs:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>{{?IPAddress  "@IPAddress-IPAddress@";}</p>
									</div>
									<p class="feature margin">Finally, the core relationship is added:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>{?AssetID ?Accesses ?IPAddress}}</p>
									</div>
									<p class="feature margin">Thus, the completed query is generated and loaded into the question sheet:</p>
									<div class="code">
										<p>CONSTRUCT {?AssetID ?Accesses ?IPAddress} WHERE {{?IPAddress  "@IPAddress-IPAddress@";}{?IPAddress  ;}{?Accesses   ;}{?AssetID  ;}{?AssetID ?Accesses ?IPAddress}}</p>
									</div>
									<p class="feature margin">Again, this document does not include extensive SPARQL instructions or details.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Additional documentation surrounding writing SPARQL queries can be found at SEMOSS.org and through Bob DuCharme's book, Learning SPARQL.</p>
			</div>				
			<div id="security-usecase">
									<h4 class="margin">Security Use-Case</h4>
									<p class="feature">The Security use-case example is meant to show how a network security analyst can identify meaningful insights surrounding a potential network infiltration by a malicious host. The scenario envisioned is that an employee likely visited a malicious website and that site infected the computer, and then a number of servers that support the enterprise.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The security analyst is interested in identifying the employee that went to the site, and identifying the potential impact to the enterprise of the malicious traffic.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">The team has also generated a Youtube video discussing the concept (4.1) surrounding the security database as well as the actual use-case of traversing through the videos in the application.</p>
									<h6 class="darkgray">4.1 Concept</h6>
									<p class="feature">Like most enterprises this data is located in disparate, disconnected data sets. Likely, there is a PeopleSoft Oracle solution which manages HR information for the company, an active-directory based asset database that contains all of the assets connected to the enterprise, and a web traffic log provided by the network support team. These databases are likely disconnected, and on-face, do not communicate with each other.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">In order to identify information about the security breach, however, these databases will need to communicate to connect information surrounding the attack.</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img12.png" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 4.1.1 Disparate Databases</p>
									<p class="feautre margin">The SEMOSS team has extracted specific, relevant components from these databases and generated a metamodel (more information surrounding metamodels can be found in section 2.1).</p>
									<p class="feautre margin">However, this data is unfiltered and it must be processed and connected in SEMOSS for actionable insights to be generated. The Security metamodel is located in figure 4.1.2 below.</p>
									<p class="feautre margin">Essentially, the three disparate databases are connected through the metamodel and can be combined to generate insights surrounding the attack that occurred.</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img13.png" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 4.1.2 Security Database Metamodel</p>
									<h6 class="darkgray">4.2 Generating Insights</h6>
									<p class="feature">Traversing through the database is relatively straightforward. Let's imagine that the IP Address is known (for our demo we have used IAmAVirus.Com), and we want to identify insights surrounding what employees have accessed this host.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">First select the (1) WebLog database (since the initial connection surrounds web traffic), then select the (2) Security Perspective, and then select a (3) Specific Question. In this case, the analyst is interested in identifying what workstations (assets) have accessed the particular IP Address.</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img14.jpg" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 4.1.2 Security Database Metamodel</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Once the query is created, the available parameters are selected, in this case the IP Address, and then the create button is pressed to generate the initial graph (figure 4.2.2 below).</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img15.jpg" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 4.2.2 Workstation IP Address Query</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Once the query is created, the available parameters are selected, in this case the IP Address, and then the create buttonNow, all of the workstation assets that have accessed that particular IP address have been identified.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Next, the analyst might be interested in the usernames associated with those particular asset identifiers. By first selecting the database to traverse to (e.g. the Asset Database) and then by right clicking on the individual node in question, the user can traverse to another node. In this case, the analyst will traverse through to username (figure 4.2.4 below).</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img16.jpg" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature margin">Next, the user may be interested in identifying the names of the employees involved, so by switching to the PeopleSoft database perspective the analyst can traverse through to this question.</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Next, the user may be interested in where these individuals are located (perhaps the security breach has occurred at a specific location), so the user can traverse through to these locations to identify the specific area where the breach has occurred (as in figure 4.2.5 below).</p>
									<img src="res/images/ui-img17.jpg" class="sizing">
									<p class="feature">Figure 4.2.5 Security Database Metamodel</p>
									<p class="feature margin">Finally, the analyst may be interested in what servers those assets have accessed, so by switching back to the traffic log, the user can traverse through to server. In addition, highlight adjacent functionality can be used to identify the specific nodes that a particular instance touches;</p>
